**A parody of the famous and timeless poem ‘The Road Not Taken’ by Robert Frost:**

A dhokla and Khichdi diverged by me by in a yellow plate,
And sorry I could not eat both
And be one foodie, long I stood
And looked at it as hard as I could
To where the texture fluffed, aroma enticed and tongue salivated

Then took the dhokla with chutney and chillies, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better savour,
Alas, my stomach was upset and wanted gut-friendly bacteria proletariat;
Though after digestion,
Both had to meet the same fate,

And both that morning equally lay,
In chillies, no mouth had embraced the ‘ooh ah mirchee’.
Oh, I kept the khichdi for another day!
Yet knowing how the dhokla will lead to samosa and then kachori too,
I doubted if my tummy will ever thank me!

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
A dhokla and Khichdi diverged by me in a yellow plate,
I took the one my stomach didn’t appreciate,
And that has made all the difference (the next morning)

**P.S. The original work that I took inspiration from:**

**The Road Not Taken
-By Robert Frost**

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I —
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
