<p>If you‚Äôre from India, chances are you might have seen this ad:</p>

<p>Rin is a low cost cleaning bar for clothes and claims to wash clothes with less water</p>

<p>Watch the ad 5‚Äì6 times to notice the elements that are carefully designed to address consumer problems and the interplay of Logos, Pathos and Ethos, the cannons of Rhetoric ‚Äî</p>

<h2 id="1water-scarcity">1.Water Scarcity</h2>
<p>An analysis by Unilever globally shows that around 38 per cent of Unilever‚Äôs water footprint comes from the laundry process and a significant proportion of this is washing laundry by hand in several developing countries, including India</p>

<p>Also, many ‚ÄòIndias‚Äô are already facing an acute water shortage especially in Summer months, the problem is more heightened in semi-urban and rural areas. A product like a detergent bar that uses considerably less water (claimed half of the water than a conventional soap bar) would definitely be a hit!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Visual cues:
-‚ÄùMaa Tanki Khaali hai‚Äù with an empty tank at the start
-Two bucketfuls of water saved</p>

<h2 id="2-shining-clothes--more-self-esteem-where-will-the-shine-come-from-our-brand-new-detergent-bar">2. Shining Clothes = More Self Esteem. Where will the shine come from? Our brand new detergent bar!</h2>
<p>The ad dismisses the myth that extra water is required for clean clothes. It strategically shows the young woman with white shiny clothes walking with confidence and pride. In effect, the ad is not selling Rin Bar but the confidence that comes from wearing shiny clothes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Visual cues:
-The flash and the lightening sound while describing the Smart Foam Technology subtly ingrains the cleaning prowess of the bar
-The tag line ‚ÄùChamkate Rehna‚Äù or ‚ÄúKeep Shining‚Äù further reiterates the point
-The woman literally dazzles with glitters around her as she walks on the road after cleaning her share of clothes in half the water</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="3-smartfoam-technology">3. SmartFoam Technology</h2>
<p>To boost its credibility, the ad educates us of the soap‚Äôs SmartFoam patented technology that testifies that the detergent bar will use half the water to clean!</p>

<h2 id="4-targets-the-common-man">4. Targets the common man!</h2>
<p>The target group for this ad is definitely the lower middle/middle class who as always, are the most affected due to any economic downturn, climate change and disasters. The privileged ones do not face the problem of an empty tank. The characters and surroundings in the ad film are humble and that makes it all the more relatable to the common man!</p>

<p>This ad is definitely a master piece and its effects did show up in their sales figures in Maharashtra, India in 2017 where they overtook the then local market leader ‚Äî Ghadi! Kudos to the ad agency! Of course, this wasn‚Äôt the only ad in their campaign to launch this new product.
A ton of social awareness campaigns and assisting the construction of dams with local governments in Maharashtra were their masterstrokes! They also roped in dhobis (washermen) in their ads to speak on their behalf because well, <strong>will you listen to the famous SRK or the humble dhobi when it comes to advice on cleaning clothes?</strong></p>

<p><strong>This ad and the claimed innovation is a product of deep consumer research and insights and I appreciate that.</strong></p>

<h3 id="but-should-we-listen-to-the-consumer-only-is-an-uninitiated-consumer-aware-of-all-the-issues-around-detergents-and-bars">But should we listen to the consumer ONLY? Is an uninitiated consumer AWARE of all the issues around detergents and bars?</h3>

<p>I dug a little deeper and found out problems associated with detergents in India:</p>

<p>**In India, most of the synthetic detergents are not phosphate-free due to lack of mandatory legislation. Phosphate is banned in many countries but not in India. Some manufacturers tend to put in liberal quantities of phosphates in detergents to increase the cleaning efficacy.</p>

<p>Also, no detergent brand available in the market has opted for the Indian ecolabel (known as Ecomark), which certifies environment-friendliness of a product. The BIS has laid down the standards for Eco-labelling of detergents in India. The standards suggest replacing phosphates with any other environment-friendly substance. Guess what? No brand had opted for it**
(Source: https://www.conzumr.com/br/DETERGENTBARS/compare?prodList=8163,8167)</p>

<p>As for Rin, the phosphate content was at 2.46% which is better than Surf Excel at 7.69 per cent by mass, followed by Ghari at 3.26 percent. All the other brands contained less than two per cent of phosphates. Nirma with 0.01 per cent and Reliance Sudz with 0.03 per cent reported the lowest percentages of phosphate content.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúOnce phosphates are discharged into the environment, they promote algae growth in local waters. These sudden blooms of algae trigger a process called eutrophication in which local waters become starved of oxygen and devoid of life ‚Äî killing fish, dolphins and plants‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only Phosphates, even the packaging of these soap bars (and a ton of other FMCG products) is such that it does nothing to address the huge huge problem associated with plastic waste especially of these small and colored kinds which CANNOT BE RECYCLED!!!</p>

<p>An environmentally superior detergent is one that uses fewer chemical ingredients. The toxicity of detergents decreases if you remove additives like perfumes, colour and brightening agents. Synthetic surfactants may be replaced by non petrochemical surfactants or vegetable oil soaps; dyes and fragrances can be eliminated or minimized. Minimal packaging can also reduce environmental harm substantially. Remember the Bangalore lake frothing?</p>

<p>Exhibit:</p>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*ec6NvVvKo5mpCuiy.png" alt="Foamy Lake" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúExperts say the ubiquity of washing machines in urban India and indiscriminate use of detergent by households have come together to turn Bellandur Lake into a foamy disaster. Incidentally, around 40% of 1,800 households surveyed in eastern Bengaluru (where the water body is located) were found to be using at least five kg of detergent in a month.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So much for a smart foam :(</strong></p>

<p>**Band-aids do not fix bullet holes. Does Rin‚Äôs two bucketfuls saved, polluted yet, solve the problem?</p>

<p>I have personally found soap-nut shells to be a great detergent with only a minor hassle to soak it overnight prior to use and it generates less foam than a conventional detergent. It cleans just as well and is devoid of all the harm associated with pollutants in a basic store brought detergent.</p>

<p>P.S. soap-nuts would require less water too because of less lather produced and can be used for 7‚Äì8 washes, if only the humble soap-nut could market its water saving, life friendly, ahimsac properties.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a need to add one more arm to marketing- <strong>Revere the earth and its 5Rs- reduce, replace, refurbish, recycle, reinvent!</strong></p>
