I"ÿ<p>Hi!</p>

<p>Welcome to my blog! :)</p>

<p>I‚Äôm Dhanushree.</p>

<p>A lot of books have shaped my value system. One such book was on nutrition by Rujuta Diwekar. She brought forth the idea of <strong>‚ÄòAct Local, Think Global‚Äô</strong>.

<p>That resonated deeply with me..</p>

<p>How I interpret it as- big problems often need to be solved by taking small steps using the most locally available resources and in turn, making progress as much sustainable as possible.</p>

<p>I have translated multiple iterations of this idea in my life:</p>

<p><strong>Food</strong>: My biggest and the most joyous discovery has been to uncover reservoirs of wisdom in my mom‚Äôs and other time tested recipes which focused on tapping syngery in combination foods for example: eating essential fats like coconut with seeds like sesame for optimum absorbtion.</p>

<p><strong>Fitness</strong>: How important it is to have a wholesome fitness routine and fitness as a way of life that empowers you towards an active and healthy lifestyle.</p>

<p><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: Everything that has come to us, be it something as trivial as socks or as big as a car - right from its producton to its eventual decay: environment, societies and people get impacted. It is extremely critical to thoughtfully choose what we buy and use. As Ursula Le Guin put it beautifully - ‚Äúto light a candle is to cast a shadow.‚Äù
P.S. do watch the documentary called The Ship Breakers to understand this perspective.</p>

<p>Onto my next step, I am thinking of ways how I can make my career and purpose intersect :)</p>

<p>On my blog, I regularly share my thoughts and discoveries.</p>
