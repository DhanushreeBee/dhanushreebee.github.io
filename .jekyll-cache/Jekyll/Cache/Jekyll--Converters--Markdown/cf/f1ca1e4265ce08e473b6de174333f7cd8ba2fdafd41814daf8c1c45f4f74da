<strong>- Michael Pollen in Food Rules</strong></p>

<p>The deeper ideology behind viewing food and nutrition, should not be in an ever evasive way of fad diets like â€˜one Super-Foodâ€™, or the â€˜magic fat-melting pillâ€™. A sustained diet should resonate with our culture and should be as simple as possible.</p>

<p>UN-FAO in its report <a href="https://www.wfp.org/publications/2018-state-food-security-and-nutrition-world-sofi-report">â€˜The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the Worldâ€™</a> says that towards solving the double burden of â€˜Malnourishmentâ€™ that the world faces today, local and indigenous crops are the saviours in terms of providing robust nutrition and crop genetics that are climate resilient. Old is indeed gold!</p>

<p>I try to resonate my food choices with that of the local climate and as much as possible, reduce the food miles. 
As for fitness, Iâ€™m trying to develop a regular routine consisting of weight training, yoga and running.</p>

<p>Books and webistes I regularly go to for advice on exercises and food:</p>
