I"U<p>They said our relationship would never knit, that there would be no heat! 
They were wrong, for I love you to the brim!
Shall I compare thee <strong>on</strong> a winter’s day to summer, temperate and lov-wooly as ever?</p>

<p>When you let yourself wrap around my porcelain skin, as your snuggly hands cup me, my boiling innards let out a sigh. 
You take away my breath, I see it evaporating..</p>

<p>Although we’re separated by distance, you in the big cupboard, lonely 
amidst the crowd almost always unkempt, 
and I in the kitchen hung-over in your absence whelmed in the constant clink of life,
our love sustains, it can never fade, 
neither in the laundry nor in the dishwasher for no soap or detergent can remove our love-stain!
Everytime we meet, brand new love we brew..</p>

<p>As time withers away our bodies, 
when I’m old, senile and cracked, 
when I can no longer ‘hold water’ and when you’re covered with lint balls all over, 
your skin full of holes, 
we’ll know our love has stood the test of time, 
in sickness and health alike.</p>

<p>And I know you will love me, even when we have forgotten our inanimate usual selves. 
I know you will love me as we repurpose our lives. 
And be assured that I will love you when you become an ‘upcycled cozy hat’ 
and I turn into a ‘best out of waste lamp’…
Our love will be sustained, ages and ages hence…</p>
