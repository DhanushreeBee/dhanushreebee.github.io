"No snacks, no seconds, no sweets (unless it is homemade) — except on days that begin with the letter S” 
**- Michael Pollen in Food Rules**

The deeper ideology behind viewing food and nutrition, should not be in an ever evasive way of fad diets like ‘one Super-Food’, or the ‘magic fat-melting pill’. A sustained diet should resonate with our culture and should be as simple as possible. 

UN-FAO in its report ['The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World'](https://www.wfp.org/publications/2018-state-food-security-and-nutrition-world-sofi-report) says that towards solving the double burden of ‘Malnourishment’ that the world faces today, local and indigenous crops are the saviours in terms of providing robust nutrition and crop genetics that are climate resilient. Old is indeed gold!

I try to resonate my food choices with that of the local climate and as much as possible, reduce the food miles. 
As for fitness, I'm trying to develop a regular routine consisting of weight training, yoga and running. 

Books and webistes I regularly go to for advice on exercises and food:

**Fitness:** 
* [ErRx.net]([https://exrx.net/WeightTraining) for developing a weight training/calisthenics routine

* [Yoga](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn_k3SNgp0_clbdoR4boTgA) Guided Sivananda Yoga Routines- perfect for energizing and relaxing at the same time. 

**Food**
