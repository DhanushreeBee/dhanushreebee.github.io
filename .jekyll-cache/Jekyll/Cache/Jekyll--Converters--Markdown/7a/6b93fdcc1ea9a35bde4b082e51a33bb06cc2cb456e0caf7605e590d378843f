I"®<p><strong>A parody of the famous and timeless poem â€˜The Road Not Takenâ€™ by Robert Frost:</strong></p>

<p>A dhokla and Khichdi diverged by me by in a yellow plate,
And sorry I could not eat both
And be one foodie, long I stood
And looked at it as hard as I could
To where the texture fluffed, aroma enticed and tongue salivated</p>

<p>Then took the dhokla with chutney and chillies, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better savour,
Alas, my stomach was upset and wanted gut-friendly bacteria proletariat;
Though after digestion,
Both had to meet the same fate,</p>

<p>And both that morning equally lay,
In chillies, no mouth had embraced the â€˜ooh ah mircheeâ€™.
Oh, I kept the khichdi for another day!
Yet knowing how the dhokla will lead to samosa and then kachori too,
I doubted if my tummy will ever thank me!</p>

<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
A dhokla and Khichdi diverged by me in a yellow plate,
I took the one my stomach didnâ€™t appreciate,
And that has made all the difference (the next morning)</p>

<p><strong>P.S. The original work that I took inspiration from:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Road Not Taken
-By Robert Frost</strong></p>

<p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>

<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,</p>

<p>And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>

<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I â€”
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.</p>
